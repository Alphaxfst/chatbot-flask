# chatbot-tvlk

Machine Learning contribute to the chatbot model development. Development starts from creating chatbot dataset from scratch, build a model using Tensorflow,
improve the model to reduce overfitting, and deploy the model on a local server which will then be continued by the CC team for deployment in the cloud services.
